### robot_workstation_setup

This repository contains scripts that allow for end users and lab assistants to easily set up computers for ROS work after a fresh installation of Ubuntu.

Currently, we only have a script for setting up a workstation for class code development for EECS 397/600: Modern Robotic Programming.

To run a script, make sure its permissions are correct:

`chmod 755 script.sh`

Then, run the script in bash:

`./script.sh`
